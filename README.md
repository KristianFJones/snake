# Snake  [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/avindra/snake/master.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/avindra/snake)

It is an implementation of the game of snake using reference JavaScript, and `<canvas>` for graphical output. The codebase uses Typescript (mostly for a handful of `interface` descriptions.)

There is experimental sound: unplug your headphones to rip beeps over your speakers.
