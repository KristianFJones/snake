# Snake

This is a simple game of snake implemented using various web technologies and JavaScript (`ES6`, `canvas`, `Web Audio`, to name a few).

It is both an experiment in implementing the game of snake and in using some of the latest web technologies.

## Installation / how to play

First, build the project:

```bash
npm install && npm start
```

## TODO

On the roadmap:

 * Leverage Google's Speech Synthesis API somehow
 * Multiplayer over Websockets?
 * Test suite
 * Others..
